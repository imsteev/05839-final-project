  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    For the advanced portion of our project, we wanted to create a predictive model that represented the wildfire data. More
    specifically, we wanted to see how well we could classify fire size given a set of features. Because the datasets are
    so large, supervised learning was the way to go - the dataset already provided the labels (
    <code>FIRE_SIZE_CLASS</code>). The heavy lifting required lied in cleaning the data, extracting features, and splitting the dataset into appropriate
    chunks.

    Cleaning
  </h2>
  <p>
    There were a lot of columns that were extraneous for the purposes of classification, so the only columns we used were
    <code>DISCOVERY_DATE, DISCOVERY_DOY, DISCOVERY_TIME, STAT_CAUSE_CODE, CONT_DATE, CONT_TIME, FIRE_SIZE_CLASS, and STATE</code>. Rows that had any of these columns missing were removed from the training/testing sets because we wanted to execute
    on as complete data as possible. Doing this removed further skewing, as we would have had to impute missing data, which
    doesn't really make sense without deeper knowledge about wildfires in the U.S. Finally, classification was performed
    on the dataset separated by year.

    <code>STAT_CAUSE_CODE, season, region, duration</code>

    There was a bit of experimentation with different features before settling on the above set. The reason for using fire cause
    is fairly self-explanatory. With season, we figured that there might be more fires and perhaps bigger fires during the
    summer due to dryness in certain areas like California. Region was chosen because different regions have different environments,
    resulting in
